                <h1>Here is Winter!</h1>

                    Winter. It's the darkest and often the coldest of the seasons, but with chill and the possible
                    snowfall comes the holiday season, and ample moments for cozy retreat and hibernation. Who doesn't
                    love curling up with a winter cocktail by the fireplace, snuggling up with a blanket and indulging a
                    bit. As there are for fall, spring, and summer, there are beautiful quotes to celebrate the snowy
                    season.
